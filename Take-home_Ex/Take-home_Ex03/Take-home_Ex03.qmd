# **The Task**

Apply appropriate visual analytics methods to help FishEye, a non-profit organization that focuses on illegal fishing, to better identify bias, track behavior changes, and infer temporal patterns from the knowledge graphs prepared by their data analysts.

This take home exercise is done in conjunction with the group project. My group members are [Keke](https://isss608keke.netlify.app/) and [Quek You Ting](https://isss608ytquek.netlify.app/).

# **The Source**

The task is taken from the [VAST Challenge 2024](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2024/). Only 1 Mini Case or the Grand Challenge need to be attempted.
